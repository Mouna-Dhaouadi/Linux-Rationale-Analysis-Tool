fs: add FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL;1;0
"Summary
This introduces FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL which will allows userspace to
implement something like mount -t ext4 --exclusive /dev/sda /B which
fails if a superblock for the requested filesystem does already exist";1;0
"Before this patch
$ sudo ./move-mount -f xfs -o source=/dev/sda4 /A
Requesting filesystem type xfs
Mount options requested: source=/dev/sda4
Attaching mount at /A
Moving single attached mount
Setting key(source) with val(/dev/sda4)
$ sudo ./move-mount -f xfs -o source=/dev/sda4 /B
Requesting filesystem type xfs
Mount options requested: source=/dev/sda4
Attaching mount at /B

After this patch with --exclusive as a switch for FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL

Device or resource busy | move-mount.c: 300: do_fsconfig: i xfs: reusing existing filesystem not allowed
Details
As mentioned on the list (cf";1;0
"[1]-[3]) mount requests like
mount -t ext4 /dev/sda /A are ambigous for userspace";0;0
"Either a new
superblock has been created and mounted or an existing superblock has
been reused and a bind-mount has been created";0;1
"This becomes clear in the following example where two processes create
the same mount for the same block device";0;1
"P1                                                              P2
// wins and creates superblock
fsconfig(fd_fs, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, ...)
                                                                // finds compatible superblock of P1
                                                                // spins until P1 sets SB_BORN and grabs a reference
                                                                fsconfig(fd_fs, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, ...)
move_mount(fd_mnt1, ""/A"")                                       move_mount(fd_mnt2, ""/B"")
Not just does P2 get a bind-mount but the mount options that P2
requestes are silently ignored";1;0
"The VFS itself doesn't, can't and
shouldn't enforce filesystem specific mount option compatibility";0;1
"It
only enforces incompatibility for read-only <-> read-write transitions";1;0
"mount -t ext4       /dev/sda /A
mount -t ext4 -o ro /dev/sda /B
The read-only request will fail with EBUSY as the VFS can't just
silently transition a superblock from read-write to read-only or vica
versa without risking security issues";0;1
"To userspace this silent superblock reuse can become a security issue in
because there is currently no straightforward way for userspace to know
that they did indeed manage to create a new superblock and didn't just
reuse an existing one";1;1
"This adds a new FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL command to fsconfig() that
returns EBUSY if an existing superblock would be reused";1;1
"Userspace that
needs to be sure that it did create a new superblock with the requested
mount options can request superblock creation using this command";1;1
"If the
command succeeds they can be sure that they did create a new superblock
with the requested mount options";1;1
This requires the new mount api;0;1
"With the old mount api it would be
necessary to plumb this through every legacy filesystem's
file_system_type->mount() method";1;1
"If they want this feature they are
most welcome to switch to the new mount api";1;1
"Following is an analysis of the effect of FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL on
each high-level superblock creation helper";1;0
"(1) get_tree_nodev()
    Always allocate new superblock";1;0
"Hence, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE and
    FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL are equivalent";1;0
    The binderfs or overlayfs filesystems are examples;0;0
"(4) get_tree_keyed()
    Finds an existing superblock based on sb->s_fs_info";1;0
"Hence,
    FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE would reuse an existing superblock whereas
    FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL would reject it with EBUSY";1;0
    The mqueue or nfsd filesystems are examples;0;0
"(2) get_tree_bdev()
    This effectively works like get_tree_keyed()";1;1
    The ext4 or xfs filesystems are examples;0;0
"(3) get_tree_single()
    Only one superblock of this filesystem type can ever exist";1;1
"    Hence, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE would reuse an existing superblock
    whereas FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL would reject it with EBUSY";1;0
    The securityfs or configfs filesystems are examples;0;0
"    Note that some single-instance filesystems never destroy the
    superblock once it has been created during the first mount";1;1
"For
    example, if securityfs has been mounted at least onces then the
    created superblock will never be destroyed again as long as there is
    still an LSM making use it";1;1
"Consequently, even if securityfs is
    unmounted and the superblock seemingly destroyed it really isn't
    which means that FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL will continue rejecting
    reusing an existing superblock";1;1
"    This is acceptable thugh since special purpose filesystems such as
    this shouldn't have a need to use FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL anyway
    and if they do it's probably to make sure that mount options aren't
    ignored";1;1
"Following is an analysis of the effect of FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL on
filesystems that make use of the low-level sget_fc() helper directly";1;1
"They're all effectively variants on get_tree_keyed(), get_tree_bdev(),
or get_tree_nodev()";1;0
"(5) mtd_get_sb()
    Similar logic to get_tree_keyed()";1;0
"(6) afs_get_tree()
    Similar logic to get_tree_keyed()";1;1
"(7) ceph_get_tree()
    Similar logic to get_tree_keyed()";1;0
"    Already explicitly allows forcing the allocation of a new superblock
    via CEPH_OPT_NOSHARE";1;1
This turns it into get_tree_nodev();1;1
"(8) fuse_get_tree_submount()
    Similar logic to get_tree_nodev()";1;0
"(9) fuse_get_tree()
    Forces reuse of existing FUSE superblock";1;1
"    Forces reuse of existing superblock if passed in file refers to an
    existing FUSE connection";1;1
"    If FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL is specified together with an fd
    referring to an existing FUSE connections this would cause the
    superblock reusal to fail";0;1
"If reusing is the intent then
    FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL shouldn't be specified";1;0
"(10) fuse_get_tree()
     -> get_tree_nodev()
    Same logic as in get_tree_nodev()";1;1
"(11) fuse_get_tree()
     -> get_tree_bdev()
    Same logic as in get_tree_bdev()";1;1
"(12) virtio_fs_get_tree()
     Same logic as get_tree_keyed()";1;1
"(13) gfs2_meta_get_tree()
     Forces reuse of existing gfs2 superblock";1;0
"     Mounting gfs2meta enforces that a gf2s superblock must already
     exist";0;1
If not, it will error out;1;0
"Consequently, mounting gfs2meta
     with FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL would always fail";0;0
"If reusing is the
     intent then FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE_EXCL shouldn't be specified";1;0

     Similar logic to get_tree_keyed()";1;0
"(15) nfs_get_tree_common()
