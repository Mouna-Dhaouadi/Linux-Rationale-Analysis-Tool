At some point this trick was added to initialize the value first to NaN

This is to address the issue noted in
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14365 where these hidden
classes can be initialized to SMIs at first and then deopt when we
realize they're actually doubles.

However, this fix has been long broken and has deopted the profiling
build for years because closure compiler optimizes out the first write.

I'm not sure because I haven't A/B-tested this in the JIT yet but I
think we can use negative zero and -1.1 as the initial values instead
since they're not simple integers. Negative zero `===` zero (but not
Object.is) so is the same as far as our code is concerned. The negative
value is just `< 0` comparisons.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/94e4acaa1477e65cac02ba86058cde0afe4c8f1f,2024-09-13

This is all behind the `enableOwnerStacks` flag.

This is a follow up to #29088. In that I moved type validation into the
renderer since that's the one that knows what types are allowed.
However, I only removed it from `React.createElement` and not the JSX
which was an oversight.

However, I also noticed that for invalid types we don't have the right
stack trace for throws because we're not yet inside the JSX element that
itself is invalid. We should use its stack for the stack trace. That's
the reason it's enough to just use the throw now because we can get a
good stack trace from the owner stack. This is fixed by creating a fake
Throw Fiber that gets assigned the right stack.

Additionally, I noticed that for certain invalid types like the most
common one `undefined` we error in Flight so a missing import in RSC
leads to a generic error. Instead of erroring on the Flight side we
should just let anything that's not a Server Component through to the
client and then let the Client renderer determine whether it's a valid
type or not. Since we now have owner stacks through the server too, this
will still be able to provide a good stack trace on the client that
points to the server in that case.

This lets us rethrow it in the conceptual place of the child.

There's currently a problem when we suspend or throw in the child fiber
reconciliation phase. This work is done by the parent component, so if
it suspends or errors it is as if that component errored or suspended.
However, conceptually it's like a child suspended or errored.

In theory any thing can throw but it is really mainly due to either
`React.lazy` (both in the element.type position and node position),
`Thenable`s or the `Thenable`s that make up `AsyncIterable`s.

Mainly this happens because a Server Component that errors turns into a
`React.lazy`. In practice this means that if you have a Server Component
as the direct child of an Error Boundary. Errors inside of it won't be
caught.

We used to have the same problem with Thenables and Suspense but because
it's now always nested inside an inner Offscreen boundary that shields
it by being one level nested. However, when we have raw Offscreen
(Activity) boundaries they should also be able to catch the suspense if
it's in a hidden state so the problem returns. This fixes it for thrown
promises but it doesn't fix it for SuspenseException. I'm not sure this
is even the right strategy for Suspense though. It kind of relies on the
node never actually mounting/committing.

It's conceptually a little tricky because the current component can
inspect the children and make decisions based on them. Such as
SuspenseList.

The other thing that this PR tries to address is that it sets the
foundation for dealing with error reporting for Server Components that
errored. If something client side errors it'll be a stack like Server
(DebugInfo) -> Fiber -> Fiber -> Server -> (DebugInfo) -> Fiber.
However, all error reporting relies on it eventually terminating into a
Fiber that is responsible for the error. To avoid having to fork too
much it would be nice if I could create a Fiber to associate with the
error so that even a Server component error in this case ultimately
terminates in a Fiber.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/270229f0c337dc652f07ef27d2254bb922bfaa9e,2024-06-11

This one should be fully behind the `enableOwnerStacks` flag.

Instead of printing the parent Component stack all the way to the root,
this now prints the owner stack of every JSX callsite. It also includes
intermediate callsites between the Component and the JSX call so it has
potentially more frames. Mainly it provides the line number of the JSX
callsite. In terms of the number of components is a subset of the parent
component stack so it's less information in that regard. This is usually
better since it's more focused on components that might affect the
output but if it's contextual based on rendering it's still good to have
parent stack. Therefore, I still use the parent stack when printing DOM
nesting warnings but I plan on switching that format to a diff view
format instead (Next.js already reformats the parent stack like this).

__Follow ups__

- Server Components show up in the owner stack for client logs but logs
done by Server Components don't yet get their owner stack printed as
they're replayed. They're also not yet printed in the server logs of the
RSC server.

- Server Component stack frames are formatted as the server and added to
the end but this might be a different format than the browser. E.g. if
server is running V8 and browser is running JSC or vice versa. Ideally
we can reformat them in terms of the client formatting.

- This doesn't yet update Fizz or DevTools. Those will be follow ups.
Fizz still prints parent stacks in the server side logs. The stacks
added to user space `console.error` calls by DevTools still get the
parent stacks instead.

- It also doesn't yet expose these to user space so there's no way to
get them inside `onCaughtError` for example or inside a custom
`console.error` override.

- In another follow up I'll use `console.createTask` instead and
completely remove these stacks if it's available.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/d6cfa0f295f4c8b366af15fd20c84e27cdd1fab7,2024-05-25

This is necessary to simplify the component stack handling to make way
for owner stacks. It also solves some hacks that we used to have but
don't quite make sense. It also solves the problem where things like key
warnings get silenced in RSC because they get deduped. It also surfaces
areas where we were missing key warnings to begin with.

Almost every type of warning is issued from the renderer. React Elements
are really not anything special themselves. They're just lazily invoked
functions and its really the renderer that determines there semantics.

We have three types of warnings that previously fired in
JSX/createElement:

- Fragment props validation.
- Type validation.
- Key warning.

It's nice to be able to do some validation in the JSX/createElement
because it has a more specific stack frame at the callsite. However,
that's the case for every type of component and validation. That's the
whole point of enableOwnerStacks. It's also not sufficient to do it in
JSX/createElement so we also have validation in the renderers too. So
this validation is really just an eager validation but also happens
again later.

The problem with these is that we don't really know what types are valid
until we get to the renderer. Additionally, by placing it in the
isomorphic code it becomes harder to do deduping of warnings in a way
that makes sense for that renderer. It also means we can't reuse logic
for managing stacks etc.

Fragment props validation really should just be part of the renderer
like any other component type. This also matters once we add Fragment
refs and other fragment features. So I moved this into Fiber. However,
since some Fragments don't have Fibers, I do the validation in
ChildFiber instead of beginWork where it would normally happen.

For `type` validation we already do validation when rendering. By
leaving it to the renderer we don't have to hard code an extra list.
This list also varies by context. E.g. class components aren't allowed
in RSC but client references are but we don't have an isomorphic way to
identify client references because they're defined by the host config so
the current logic is flawed anyway. I kept the early validation for now
without the `enableOwnerStacks` since it does provide a nicer stack
frame but with that flag on it'll be handled with nice stacks anyway. I
normalized some of the errors to ensure tests pass.

For `key` validation it's the same principle. The mechanism for the
heuristic is still the same - if it passes statically through a parent
JSX/createElement call then it's considered validated. We already did
print the error later from the renderer so this also disables the early
log in the `enableOwnerStacks` flag.

I also added logging to Fizz so that key warnings can print in SSR logs.

Flight is a bit more complex. For elements that end up on the client we
just pass the `validated` flag along to the client and let the client
renderer print the error once rendered. For server components we log the
error from Flight with the server component as the owner on the stack
which will allow us to print the right stack for context. The factoring
of this is a little tricky because we only want to warn if it's in an
array parent but we want to log the error later to get the right debug
info.

Fiber/Fizz has a similar factoring problem that causes us to create a
fake Fiber for the owner which means the logs won't be associated with
the right place in DevTools.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/84239da896fd7395a667ab1e7ef1ef338a32de8f,2024-05-23

This implements the concept of a DEV-only ""owner"" for Server Components.
The owner concept isn't really super useful. We barely use it anymore,
but we do have it as a concept in DevTools in a couple of cases so this
adds it for parity. However, this is mainly interesting because it could
be used to wire up future owner-based stacks.

I do this by outlining the DebugInfo for a Server Component
(ReactComponentInfo). Then I just rely on Flight deduping to refer to
that. I refer to the same thing by referential equality so that we can
associate a Server Component parent in DebugInfo with an owner.

If you suspend and replay a Server Component, we have to restore the
same owner. To do that, I did a little ugly hack and stashed it on the
thenable state object. Felt unnecessarily complicated to add a stateful
wrapper for this one dev-only case.

The owner could really be anything since it could be coming from a
different implementation. Because this is the first time we have an
owner other than Fiber, I have to fix up a bunch of places that assumes
Fiber. I mainly did the `typeof owner.tag === 'number'` to assume it's a
Fiber for now.

This also doesn't actually add it to DevTools / RN Inspector yet. I just
ignore them there for now.

Because Server Components can be async the owner isn't tracked after an
await. We need per-component AsyncLocalStorage for that. This can be
done in a follow up.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/f33a6b69c6cb406ea0cc51d07bc4d3fd2d8d8744,2024-04-05

switches `createContext` implementation so that `Context.Provider ===

Consumer's fiber type is now always an intermediate object (rather than
it being sometimes the context itself and sometimes an intermediate

My methodology was to start with the relevant symbols, work tags, and

That way we can use it for debug information like component stacks and
DevTools. I used an extra stack argument in Child Fiber to track this as
it's flowing down since it's not just elements where we have this info
readily available but parent arrays and lazy can merge this into the
Fiber too. It's not great that this is a dev-only argument and I could
track it globally but seems more likely to make mistakes.

It is possible for the same debug info to appear for multiple child
fibers like when it's attached to a fragment or a lazy that resolves to
a fragment at the root. The object identity could be used in these
scenarios to infer if that's really one server component that's a parent
of all children or if each child has a server component with the same
name.

This is effectively a public API because you can use it to stash
information on Promises from a third-party service - not just Server
Components. I started outline the types for this for some things I was
planning to add but it's not final.

I was also planning on storing it from `use(thenable)` for when you
suspend on a Promise. However, I realized that there's no Hook instance
for those to stash it on. So it might need a separate data structure to
stash the previous pass over of `use()` that resets each render.

Along with all the places using it like the `_debugSource` on Fiber.
This still lets them be passed into `createElement` (and JSX dev
runtime) since those can still be used in existing already compiled code
and we don't want that to start spreading to DOM attributes.

We used to have a DEV mode that compiles the source location of JSX into
the compiled output. This was nice because we could get the actual call
site of the JSX (instead of just somewhere in the component). It had a
bunch of issues though:

- It only works with JSX.
- The way this source location is compiled is different in all the
pipelines along the way. It relies on this transform being first and the
source location we want to extract but it doesn't get preserved along
source maps and don't have a way to be connected to the source hosted by
the source maps. Ideally it should just use the mechanism other source
maps use.
- Since it's expensive it only works in DEV so if it's used for
component stacks it would vary between dev and prod.
- It only captures the callsite of the JSX and not the stack between the
component and that callsite. In the happy case it's in the component but
not always.

Instead, we have another zero-cost trick to extract the call site of
each component lazily only if it's needed. This ensures that component
stacks are the same in DEV and PROD. At the cost of worse line number
information.

The better way to get the JSX call site would be to get it from `new
Error()` or `console.createTask()` inside the JSX runtime which can
capture the whole stack in a consistent way with other source mappings.
We might explore that in the future.

This removes source location info from React DevTools and React Native
Inspector. The ""jump to source code"" feature or inspection can be made
lazy instead by invoking the lazy component stack frame generation. That
way it can be made to work in prod too. The filtering based on file path
is a bit trickier.

When redesigned this UI should ideally also account for more than one
stack frame.

## Summary

Fixes: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/27296

On actions that cause a component to change its signature, and therefore
to remount, the `_debugSource` property of the fiber updates in delay
and causes the `devtools` source field to vanish.

This issue happens in
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js

```js
function beginWork(
  current: Fiber | null,
  workInProgress: Fiber,
  renderLanes: Lanes,
): Fiber | null {
  if (__DEV__) {
    if (workInProgress._debugNeedsRemount && current !== null) {
      // This will restart the begin phase with a new fiber.
      return remountFiber(
        current,
        workInProgress,
        createFiberFromTypeAndProps(
          workInProgress.type,
          workInProgress.key,
          workInProgress.pendingProps,
          workInProgress._debugOwner || null,
          workInProgress.mode,
          workInProgress.lanes,
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  // ...
```

`remountFiber` uses the 3rd parameter as the new fiber
(`createFiberFromTypeAndProps(...)`), but this parameter doesn’t contain
a `_debugSource`.

## Summary

<!--
Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem
does the pull request solve?
-->
We are upgrading React 17 codebase to React18, and `StrictMode` has been
great for surfacing potential production bugs on React18 for class
components. There are non-trivial number of test failures caused by
double `useEffect` in StrictMode. To prioritize surfacing and fixing
issues that will break in production now, we need a flag to turn off
double `useEffect` for now in StrictMode temporarily. This is a
Meta-only hack for rolling out `createRoot` and we will fast follow to
remove it and use full strict mode.

- Deletes a bunch of the gated code

The gates that are deleted are unnecessary now. We were keeping them

## Hoistables

In the original implementation of Float, all hoisted elements were
treated like Resources. They had deduplication semantics and hydrated
based on a key. This made certain kinds of hoists very challenging such
as sequences of meta tags for `og:image:...` metadata. The reason is
each tag along is not dedupable based on only it's intrinsic properties.
two identical tags may need to be included and hoisted together with
preceding meta tags that describe a semantic object with a linear set of
html nodes.

It was clear that the concept of Browser Resources (stylesheets /
scripts / preloads) did not extend universally to all hositable tags
(title, meta, other links, etc...)

Additionally while Resources benefit from deduping they suffer an
inability to update because while we may have multiple rendered elements
that refer to a single Resource it isn't unambiguous which element owns
the props on the underlying resource. We could try merging props, but
that is still really hard to reason about for authors. Instead we
restrict Resource semantics to freezing the props at the time the
Resource is first constructed and warn if you attempt to render the same
Resource with different props via another rendered element or by
updating an existing element for that Resource.

This lack of updating restriction is however way more extreme than
necessary for instances that get hoisted but otherwise do not dedupe;
where there is a well defined DOM instance for each rendered element. We
should be able to update props on these instances.

Hoistable is a generalization of what Float tries to model for hoisting.
Instead of assuming every hoistable element is a Resource we now have
two distinct categories, hoistable elements and hoistable resources. As
one might guess the former has semantics that match regular Host
Components except the placement of the node is usually in the <head>.
The latter continues to behave how the original implementation of
HostResource behaved with the first iteration of Float

### Hoistable Element
On the server hoistable elements render just like regular tags except
the output is stored in special queues that can be emitted in the stream
earlier than they otherwise would be if rendered in place. This also
allow for instance the ability to render a hoistable before even
rendering the <html> tag because the queues for hoistable elements won't
flush until after we have flushed the preamble (`<DOCTYPE
html><html><head>`).

On the client, hoistable elements largely operate like HostComponents.
The most notable difference is in the hydration strategy. If we are
hydrating and encounter a hoistable element we will look for all tags in
the document that could potentially be a match and we check whether the
attributes match the props for this particular instance. We also do this
in the commit phase rather than the render phase. The reason hydration
can be done for HostComponents in render is the instance will be removed
from the document if hydration fails so mutating it in render is safe.
For hoistables the nodes are not in a hydration boundary (Root or
SuspenseBoundary at time of writing) and thus if hydration fails and we
may have an instance marked as bound to some Fiber when that Fiber never
commits. Moving the hydration matching to commit ensures we will always
succeed in pairing the hoisted DOM instance with a Fiber that has
committed.

### Hoistable Resource
On the server and client the semantics of Resources are largely the same
they just don't apply to title, meta, and most link tags anymore.
Resources hoist and dedupe via an `href` key and are ref counted. In a
future update we will add a garbage collector so we can clean up
Resources that no longer have any references

## `<style>` support
In earlier implementations there was no support for <style> tags. This
PR adds support for treating `<style href=""...""
precedence=""..."">...</style>` as a Resource analagous to `<link
rel=""stylesheet"" href=""..."" precedence=""..."" />`

It may seem odd at first to require an href to get Resource semantics
for a style tag. The rationale is that these are for inlining of actual
external stylesheets as an optimization and for URI like scoping of
inline styles for css-in-js libraries. The href indicates that the key
space for `<style>` and `<link rel=""stylesheet"" />` Resources is shared.
and the precedence is there to allow for interleaving of both kinds of
Style resources. This is an advanced feature that we do not expect most
app developers to use directly but will be quite handy for various
styling libraries and for folks who want to inline as much as possible
once Fizz supports this feature.

## refactor notes
* HostResource Fiber type is renamed HostHoistable to reflect the
generalization of the concept
* The Resource object representation is modified to reduce hidden class
checks and to use less memory overall
* The thing that distinguishes a resource from an element is whether the
Fiber has a memoizedState. If it does, it will use resource semantics,
otherwise element semantics
* The time complexity of matching hositable elements for hydration
should be improved",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/6396b664118442f3c2eae7bf13732fcb27bda98f,2023-02-10

`Offscreen.attach` is imperative API to signal to Offscreen that its
updates should be high priority and effects should be mounted. Coupled
with `Offscreen.detach` it gives ability to manually control Offscreen.
Unlike with mode `visible` and `hidden`, it is developers job to make
sure contents of Offscreen are not visible to users.
`Offscreen.attach` only works if mode is `manual`.

Example uses:
```jsx
let offscreenRef = useRef(null);
<Offscreen mode={'manual'} ref={offscreenRef)}>
  <Child />
</Offscreen>

// ------

// Offscreen is attached by default. 
// For example user scrolls away and Offscreen subtree is not visible anymore.

// User scrolls back and Offscreen subtree is visible again.

land anywhere else, including the experimental release channel.
Typically we do this so we can gradually roll out the feature behind
a flag before deciding to enable it.

The way we test those features today is by mutating the
`shared/ReactFeatureFlags` module. There are a few downsides to this
approach, though. The flag is only overridden for the specific tests or
test suites where you apply the override. But usually what you want is
to run *all* tests with the flag enabled, to protect against unexpected
regressions.

Also, mutating the feature flags module only works when running the
tests against source, not against the final build artifacts, because the
ReactFeatureFlags module is inlined by the build script.

Instead, we should run the test suite against the www configuration,
just like we do for prod, experimental, and so on. I've added a new
command, `yarn test-www`. It automatically runs in CI.

Some of the www feature flags are dynamic; that is, they depend on
a runtime condition (i.e. a GK). These flags are imported from an
external module that lives in www. Those flags will be enabled for some
clients and disabled for others, so we should run the tests against
*both* modes.

So I've added a new global `__VARIANT__`, and a new test command `yarn
test-www-variant`. `__VARIANT__` is set to false by default; when
running `test-www-variant`, it's set to true.

If we were going for *really* comprehensive coverage, we would run the
tests against every possible configuration of feature flags: 2 ^
numberOfFlags total combinations. That's not practical, though, so
instead we only run against two combinations: once with `__VARIANT__`
set to `true`, and once with it set to `false`. We generally assume that
flags can be toggled independently, so in practice this should
be enough.

You can also refer to `__VARIANT__` in tests to detect which mode you're
running in. Or, you can import `shared/ReactFeatureFlags` and read the
specific flag you can about. However, we should stop mutating that
module going forward. Treat it as read-only.

In this commit, I have only setup the www tests to run against source.
I'll leave running against build for a follow up.

Many of our tests currently assume they run only in the default
configuration, and break when certain flags are toggled. Rather than fix
these all up front, I've hard-coded the relevant flags to the default
values. We can incrementally migrate those tests later.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/115cd12d9bbb2bff303e52feb1394e3a2cef20ca,2020-03-06

* Move dehydrated to be child of regular SuspenseComponent

We now store the comment node on SuspenseState instead and that indicates
that this SuspenseComponent is still dehydrated.

We also store a child but that is only used to represent the DOM node for
deletions and getNextHostSibling.

* Move logic from DehydratedSuspenseComponent to SuspenseComponent

Forked based on SuspenseState.dehydrated instead.

* Retry logic for dehydrated boundary

We can now simplify the logic for retrying dehydrated boundaries without
hydrating. This is becomes simply a reconciliation against the dehydrated
fragment which gets deleted, and the new children gets inserted.

* Remove dehydrated from throw

Instead we use the regular Suspense path. To save code, we attach retry
listeners in the commit phase even though technically we don't have to.

* Pop to nearest Suspense

I think this is right...?

* Popping hydration state should skip past the dehydrated instance

* Split mount from update and special case suspended second pass

The DidCapture flag isn't used consistently in the same way. We need
further refactor for this.

* Reorganize update path

If we remove the dehydration status in the first pass and then do a second
pass because we suspended, then we need to continue as if it didn't
previously suspend. Since there is no fragment child etc.

However, we must readd the deletion.

* Schedule context work on the boundary and not the child

* Warn for Suspense hydration in legacy mode

It does a two pass render that client renders the content.

* Rename DehydratedSuspenseComponent -> DehydratedFragment

This now doesn't represent a suspense boundary itself. Its parent does.

This Fiber represents the fragment around the dehydrated content.

* Add a bunch of optimizations to SuspenseList

We now are able to bail out of reconciliation and splitting out the tail
during deep updates that hasn't changed the child props. This only
works while the list wasn't suspended before.

I also moved the second render of the ""head"" to the complete phase. This
cleans it up a bit for the tail collapsing PR.

For this second pass I also use a new technique of resetting the child
Fibers for the second pass. This is effectively a fast path to avoid
reconciling the children against props again.

* Move to didSuspend from SuspenseListState to the effectTag

The effectTag now tracks whether the previous commit was suspended.

This frees up SuspenseListState to be render-phase only state.

We use null to mean the default ""independent"" mode.

* Rename to SuspenseListState to SuspenseListRenderState

* Reuse SuspenseListRenderState across render passes

* Add optimization to bail out of scanning children if they can't be suspended

This optimized the deep update case or initial render without anything
suspending.

We have some information available to us that tell us if nothing has
suspended in the past and nothing has suspended this render pass.

This also fixes a bug where we didn't tag the previous render as having
suspended boundaries if we didn't need to force a rerender.

* Add a minimal failing test for hot reload

* Set up scaffolding for React Fresh

* Consider type family when comparing elementType

Rendering an element with stale type should not cause it to remount.

We only do this for FunctionComponent tag since checking is unnecessary for classes or host components.

* Add support for forwardRef()

Initially I thought I would compare families of inner .render functions.

However, there is a corner case where this can create false positives. Such as when you forwardRef(X) the same X twice. Those are supposed to be distinct. But if we compare .render functions, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them after first reload.

It seems safer to rely on explicit registration for those. This should be easy when forwardRef() call is in the same file, and usually it would be. For cases like HOCs and style.div`...` factories that return forwardRef(), we could have the __register__ helper itself ""dig deeper"" and register the inner function.

* Show how forwardRef inner identity can be inferred

The __register__ implementation can read the inner identity itself.

* Add missing __DEV__ to tests

* Add support for memo() (without fixing bailouts)

This adds rudimentary support for memo components. However, we don't actually skip bailouts yet, so this is not very useful by itself alone. Tests have TODOs that we need to remove after bailout skipping is done.

* Refactor type comparison for clarity

* Hot update shouldn't re-render ancestor components unnecessarily

My code had a bug where it checked for a wrong thing in a wrong set, leading us to always re-render.

This fixes the checks so that we only schedule updates for things that were actually edited.

* Add test coverage for memo(fn, areEqual)

* Explicitly skip bailouts for hot reloading fibers

This forces even memo() with shallow comparison to re-render on hot update.

* Refactor scheduling update to reduce duplication

* Remove unused variable in test

* Don't check presence in a set while not hot reloading

* Make scheduleHotUpdate() take named arguments

* Don't keep unedited component types in the type => family map

It's unnecessary because if they haven't been edited, there's no special reconciliation logic.

* Add signatures that force remounting

Signatures let us force a remount of a type even if from React's point of view, type is the same.

A type has one current signature. If that signature changes during next hot update, all Fibers with that type should be deleted and remounted.

We do this by mutating elementType scheduling a parent.

This will be handy to force remount of mismatching Hooks, as well as failed error boundaries.

For this to fully work, we'll need to add a way to skip built-in bailouts for all Fiber types. This will be the most invasive and annoying change. I did it for HostRoot in this PR but there's more. I'll add an automated test case that catches the missing bailout bailouts.

* Support forced remounting for all component types

This teaches all parent component types to remount their child if necessary.

It also adds tests for them.

* Remount effects while preserving state for hot reloaded components

This makes sure that changes to *code* always propagate.

It can break components that aren't resilient to useEffect over-firing, but that seems like a good constraint since you might need to add a dependency later anyway, and this helps avoid coding yourself into the corner.

* Add missing __DEV__ blocks to tests

* Fix unused variables in tests

* Remove outdated TODO

* Expose scheduleHotUpdate directly

* Inline isCompatibleType

* Run one check per component for invalidating deps

This also makes the bailouts more targeted--no need to remount useEffect for a parent component of remounted fiber.

* Resolve .type early

This moves resolving to set up the right .type early instead of doing this before render.
A bit more future-proof in case we want to restructure the begin phase later.

ForwardRef is special because its type is a wrapper but it can be hot reloaded by itself.
So we have a special overload for it that reconstucts the wrapper type if needed.

* Add a Suspense todo

* Use current.type !== workInProgress.type for ignoring deps

This gets rid of one of the sets.

* Use workInProgress.type !== current.type check for force re-render

We still use a set for forced remount though.

* Add Batched Mode

React has an unfortunate quirk where updates are sometimes synchronous
-- where React starts rendering immediately within the call stack of
`setState` — and sometimes batched, where updates are flushed at the
end of the current event. Any update that originates within the call
stack of the React event system is batched. This encompasses most
updates, since most updates originate from an event handler like
`onClick` or `onChange`. It also includes updates triggered by lifecycle
methods or effects. But there are also updates that originate outside
React's event system, like timer events, network events, and microtasks
(promise resolution handlers). These are not batched, which results in
both worse performance (multiple render passes instead of single one)
and confusing semantics.

Ideally all updates would be batched by default. Unfortunately, it's
easy for components to accidentally rely on this behavior, so changing
it could break existing apps in subtle ways.

One way to move to a batched-by-default model is to opt into Concurrent
Mode (still experimental). But Concurrent Mode introduces additional
semantic changes that apps may not be ready to adopt.

This commit introduces an additional mode called Batched Mode. Batched
Mode enables a batched-by-default model that defers all updates to the
next React event. Once it begins rendering, React will not yield to
the browser until the entire render is finished.

Batched Mode is superset of Strict Mode. It fires all the same warnings.
It also drops the forked Suspense behavior used by Legacy Mode, in favor
of the proper semantics used by Concurrent Mode.

I have not added any public APIs that expose the new mode yet. I'll do
that in subsequent commits.

* Suspense in Batched Mode

Should have same semantics as Concurrent Mode.

* Use RootTag field to configure type of root

There are three types of roots: Legacy, Batched, and Concurrent.

* flushSync should not flush batched work

Treat Sync and Batched expiration times separately. Only Sync updates
are pushed to our internal queue of synchronous callbacks.

* Allow useReducer to bail out of rendering by returning previous state

This is conceptually similar to `shouldComponentUpdate`, except because
there could be multiple useReducer (or useState) Hooks in a single
component, we can only bail out if none of the Hooks produce a new
value. We also can't bail out if any the other types of inputs — state
and context — have changed.

These optimizations rely on the constraint that components are pure
functions of props, state, and context.

In some cases, we can bail out without entering the render phase by
eagerly computing the next state and comparing it to the current one.
This only works if we are absolutely certain that the queue is empty at
the time of the update. In concurrent mode, this is difficult to
determine, because there could be multiple copies of the queue and we
don't know which one is current without doing lots of extra work, which
would defeat the purpose of the optimization. However, in our
implementation, there are at most only two copies of the queue, and if
*both* are empty then we know that the current queue must be.

Removes support for using arbitrary promises as the type of a React
element. Instead, promises must be wrapped in React.lazy. This gives us
flexibility later if we need to change the protocol.

The reason is that promises do not provide a way to call their
constructor multiple times. For example:

const promiseForA = new Promise(resolve => {
  fetchA(a => resolve(a));
});

Given a reference to `promiseForA`, there's no way to call `fetchA`
again. Calling `then` on the promise doesn't run the constructor again;
it only attaches another listener.

In the future we will likely introduce an API like `React.eager` that
is similar to `lazy` but eagerly calls the constructor. That gives us
the ability to call the constructor multiple times. E.g. to increase
the priority, or to retry if the first operation failed.",https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/git/commits/d9659e499eba3089b098c32cf112b7a067bdddf1,2018-10-19

During an update, the previous props are compared to the new props. If

When the promise resolves, rendering resumes. If the resolved value
has a `default` property, it is assumed to be the default export of
an ES module, and we use that as the component type. If it does not have
a `default` property, we use the resolved value itself.

This commit adds a second field called `childExpirationTime`. Now
`expirationTime` only represents the pending work of the fiber itself.
The subtree's pending work is represented by `childExpirationTime`.

The biggest advantage is it requires fewer checks to bailout on already
finished work. For most types of work, if the `expirationTime` does not
match the render expiration time, we can bailout immediately without
any further checks. This won't work for fibers that have
`shouldComponentUpdate` semantics (class components), for which we still

We can support components that suspend outside of an async mode tree
by immediately committing their placeholders.

In strict mode, the Timeout acts effectively like an error boundary.
Within a single render pass, we unwind to the nearest Timeout and
re-render the placeholder view.

Outside of strict mode, it's not safe to unwind and re-render the
siblings without committing. (Technically, this is true of error
boundaries, too, though probably not a huge deal, since we don't support
using error boundaries for control flow (yet, at least)). We need to be
clever. What we do is pretend the suspended component rendered null.*
There's no unwinding. The siblings commit like normal.

Then, in the commit phase, schedule an update on the Timeout to
synchronously re-render the placeholder. Although this requires an extra
commit, it will not be observable. And because the siblings were not
blocked from committing, they don't have to be strict mode compatible.

Another caveat is that if a component suspends during an async render,
but it's captured by a non-async Timeout, we need to revert to sync
mode. In other words, if any non-async component renders, the entire
tree must complete and commit without yielding.

* Timeout component

Adds Timeout component. If a promise is thrown from inside a Timeout component,
React will suspend the in-progress render from committing. When the promise
resolves, React will retry. If the render is suspended for longer than the
maximum threshold, the Timeout switches to a placeholder state.

The timeout threshold is defined as the minimum of:
- The expiration time of the current render
- The `ms` prop given to each Timeout component in the ancestor path of the
thrown promise.

* Add a test for nested fallbacks

Co-authored-by: Andrew Clark <acdlite@fb.com>

* Resume on promise rejection

React should resume rendering regardless of whether it resolves
or rejects.

* Wrap Suspense code in feature flag

* Children of a Timeout must be strict mode compatible

Async is not required for Suspense, but strict mode is.

* Simplify list of pending work

Some of this was added with ""soft expiration"" in mind, but now with our revised
model for how soft expiration will work, this isn't necessary.

It would be nice to remove more of this, but I think the list itself is inherent
because we need a way to track the start times, for <Timeout ms={ms} />.

* Only use the Timeout update queue to store promises, not for state

It already worked this way in practice.

* Wrap more Suspense-only paths in the feature flag

* Attach promise listener immediately on suspend

Instead of waiting for commit phase.

* Infer approximate start time using expiration time

* Remove list of pending priority levels

We can replicate almost all the functionality by tracking just five
separate levels: the highest/lowest priority pending levels, the
highest/lowest priority suspended levels, and the lowest pinged level.

We lose a bit of granularity, in that if there are multiple levels of
pending updates, only the first and last ones are known. But in practice
this likely isn't a big deal.

These heuristics are almost entirely isolated to a single module and
can be adjusted later, without API changes, if necessary.

Non-IO-bound work is not affected at all.

* ReactFiberPendingWork -> ReactFiberPendingPriority

* Renaming method names from ""pending work"" to ""pending priority""

* Get rid of SuspenseThenable module

Idk why I thought this was neccessary

* Nits based on Sebastian's feedback

* More naming nits + comments

* Add test for hiding a suspended tree to unblock

* Revert change to expiration time rounding

This means you have to account for the start time approximation
heuristic when writing Suspense tests, but that's going to be
true regardless.

When updating the tests, I also made a fix related to offscreen
priority. We should never timeout inside a hidden tree.

* Decouple update queue from Fiber type

The update queue is in need of a refactor. Recent bugfixes (#12528) have
exposed some flaws in how it's modeled. Upcoming features like Suspense
and [redacted] also rely on the update queue in ways that weren't
anticipated in the original design.

Major changes:

- Instead of boolean flags for `isReplace` and `isForceUpdate`, updates
have a `tag` field (like Fiber). This lowers the cost for adding new
types of updates.
- Render phase updates are special cased. Updates scheduled during
the render phase are dropped if the work-in-progress does not commit.
This is used for `getDerivedStateFrom{Props,Catch}`.
- `callbackList` has been replaced with a generic effect list. Aside
from callbacks, this is also used for `componentDidCatch`.

* Remove first class UpdateQueue types and use closures instead

I tried to avoid this at first, since we avoid it everywhere else in the Fiber
codebase, but since updates are not in a hot path, the trade off with file size
seems worth it.

* Store captured errors on a separate part of the update queue

This way they can be reused independently of updates like
getDerivedStateFromProps. This will be important for resuming.

* Revert back to storing hasForceUpdate on the update queue

Instead of using the effect tag. Ideally, this would be part of the
return type of processUpdateQueue.

* Rename UpdateQueue effect type back to Callback

I don't love this name either, but it's less confusing than UpdateQueue
I suppose. Conceptually, this is usually a callback: setState callbacks,
componentDidCatch. The only case that feels a bit weird is Timeouts,
which use this effect to attach a promise listener. I guess that kinda
fits, too.

* Call getDerivedStateFromProps every render, even if props did not change

Rather than enqueue a new setState updater for every props change, we
can skip the update queue entirely and merge the result into state at
the end. This makes more sense, since ""receiving props"" is not an event
that should be observed. It's still a bit weird, since eventually we do
persist the derived state (in other words, it accumulates).

* Store captured effects on separate list from ""own"" effects (callbacks)

For resuming, we need the ability to discard the ""own"" effects while
reusing the captured effects.

* Optimize for class components

Change `process` and `callback` to match the expected payload types
for class components. I had intended for the update queue to be reusable
for both class components and a future React API, but we'll likely have
to fork anyway.

* Store nearest provider on context object

* Handle reentrancy in server renderer

* Bailout of consumer updates using bitmask

The context type defines an optional function that compares two context
values, returning a bitfield. A consumer may specify the bits it needs
for rendering. If a provider's context changes, and the consumer's bits
do not intersect with the changed bits, we can skip the consumer.

This is similar to how selectors are used in Redux but fast enough to do
while scanning the tree. The only user code involved is the function
that computes the changed bits. But that's only called once per provider
update, not for every consumer.

* Store current value and changed bits on context object

There are fewer providers than consumers, so better to do this work
at the provider.

* Use maximum of 31 bits for bitmask

This is the largest integer size in V8 on 32-bit systems. Warn in
development if too large a number is used.

ReactChildFiber contains lots of branches that do the same thing for
different child types. We can unify them by having more child types be
ReactElements. This requires that the `type` and `key` fields are
sufficient to determine the identity of the child.

The main benefit is decreased file size, especially as we add more
component types, like context providers and consumers.

This updates Call and Return components to use ReactElement. Portals are
left alone for now because their identity includes the host instance.

* Update build size

* [CS] Clone container instead of new root concept

The extra ""root"" concept is kind of unnecessary. Instead of having a
mutable container even in the persistent mode, I'll instead make the
container be immutable too and be cloned. Then the ""commit"" just becomes
swapping the previous container for the new one.

* Change the signature or persistence again

We may need to clone without any updates, e.g. when the children are changed.

Passing in the previous node is not enough to recycle since it won't have the
up-to-date props and children. It's really only useful to for allocation pooling.

* Implement persistent updates

This forks the update path for host fibers. For mutation mode we mark
them as having an effect. For persistence mode, we clone the stateNode with
new props/children.

Next I'll do HostRoot and HostPortal.

* Refine protocol into a complete and commit phase

finalizeContainerChildren will get called at the complete phase.
replaceContainer will get called at commit.

Also, drop the keepChildren flag. We'll never keep children as we'll never
update a container if none of the children has changed.

* Implement persistent updates of roots and portals

These are both ""containers"". Normally we rely on placement/deletion effects
to deal with insertions into the containers. In the persistent mode we need
to clone the container and append all the changed children to it.

I needed somewhere to store these new containers before they're committed
so I added another field.

* Commit persistent work at the end by swapping out the container

* Unify cloneOrRecycle

Originally I tried to make the recyclable instance nullable but Flow didn't
like that and it's kind of sketchy since the instance type might not be
nullable.

However, the real difference which one we call is depending on whether they
are equal. We can just offload that to the renderer. Most of them won't
need to know about this at all since they'll always clone or just create
new.

The ones that do know now have to be careful to compare them so they don't
reuse an existing instance but that's probably fine to simplify the
implementation and API.

* Add persistent noop renderer for testing

* Add basic persistent tree test

* Test bail out

This adds a test for bailouts. This revealed a subtle bug. We don't set the
return pointer when stepping into newly created fibers because there
can only be one. However, since I'm reusing this mechanism for persistent
updates, I'll need to set the return pointer because a bailed out tree
won't have the right return pointer.

* Test persistent text nodes

Found another bug.

* Add persistent portal test

This creates a bit of an unfortunate feature testing in the unmount
branch.

That's because we want to trigger nested host deletions in portals in the
mutation mode.

* Don't consider container when determining portal identity

Basically, we can't use the container to determine if we should keep
identity and update an existing portal instead of recreate it. Because
for persistent containers, there is no permanent identity.

This makes it kind of strange to even use portals in this mode. It's
probably more ideal to have another concept that has permanent identity
rather than trying to swap out containers.

* Clear portals when the portal is deleted

When a portal gets deleted we need to create a new empty container and
replace the current one with the empty one.

* Add renderer mode flags for dead code elimination

* Simplify ReactNoop fix

* Add new type to the host config for persistent configs

We need container to stay as the persistent identity of the root atom.
So that we can refer to portals over time.

Instead, I'll introduce a new type just to temporarily hold the children
of a container until they're ready to be committed into the permanent
container. Essentially, this is just a fancy array that is not an array
so that the host can choose data structure/allocation for it.

* Implement new hooks

Now containers are singletons and instead their children swap. That way
portals can use the container as part of their identity again.

* Enable Yarn workspaces for packages/*

* Move src/isomorphic/* into packages/react/src/*

* Create index.js stubs for all packages in packages/*

This makes the test pass again, but breaks the build because npm/ folders aren't used yet.
I'm not sure if we'll keep this structure--I'll just keep working and fix the build after it settles down.

* Put FB entry point for react-dom into packages/*

* Move src/renderers/testing/* into packages/react-test-renderer/src/*

Note that this is currently broken because Jest ignores node_modules,
and so Yarn linking makes Jest skip React source when transforming.

* Remove src/node_modules

It is now unnecessary. Some tests fail though.

* Add a hacky workaround for Jest/Workspaces issue

Jest sees node_modules and thinks it's third party code.

This is a hacky way to teach Jest to still transform anything in node_modules/react*
if it resolves outside of node_modules (such as to our packages/*) folder.

I'm not very happy with this and we should revisit.

* Add a fake react-native package

* Move src/renderers/art/* into packages/react-art/src/*

* Move src/renderers/noop/* into packages/react-noop-renderer/src/*

It's not super clear how to organize this properly yet.

I didn't change this file but Flow started complaining.
Caleb said this annotation was unnecessarily using $Abstract though so I removed it.

* Update sizes

* Fix stats script

* Fix packaging fixtures

Use file: instead of NODE_PATH since NODE_PATH.
NODE_PATH trick only worked because we had no react/react-dom in root node_modules, but now we do.

file: dependency only works as I expect in Yarn, so I moved the packaging fixtures to use Yarn and committed lockfiles.
Verified that the page shows up.
