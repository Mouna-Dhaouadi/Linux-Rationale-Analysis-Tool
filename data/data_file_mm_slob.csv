C_kwDOACN7MtoAKDA1YTk0MDY1NmUxZWIyMDI2ZDllZTMxMDE5ZDViNDdlOTU0NTEyNGQ,Kees Cook,Vlastimil Babka,"slab: Introduce kmalloc_size_roundup()

In the effort to help the compiler reason about buffer sizes, the
__alloc_size attribute was added to allocators. This improves the scope
of the compiler's ability to apply CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS and (in the near
future) CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE. For most allocations, this works well,
as the vast majority of callers are not expecting to use more memory
than what they asked for.

There is, however, one common exception to this: anticipatory resizing
of kmalloc allocations. These cases all use ksize() to determine the
actual bucket size of a given allocation (e.g. 128 when 126 was asked
for). This comes in two styles in the kernel:

1) An allocation has been determined to be too small, and needs to be
   resized. Instead of the caller choosing its own next best size, it
   wants to minimize the number of calls to krealloc(), so it just uses
   ksize() plus some additional bytes, forcing the realloc into the next
   bucket size, from which it can learn how large it is now. For example:

	data = krealloc(data, ksize(data) + 1, gfp);
	data_len = ksize(data);

2) The minimum size of an allocation is calculated, but since it may
   grow in the future, just use all the space available in the chosen
   bucket immediately, to avoid needing to reallocate later. A good
   example of this is skbuff's allocators:

	data = kmalloc_reserve(size, gfp_mask, node, &pfmemalloc);
	...
	/* kmalloc(size) might give us more room than requested.
	 * Put skb_shared_info exactly at the end of allocated zone,
	 * to allow max possible filling before reallocation.
	 */
	osize = ksize(data);
        size = SKB_WITH_OVERHEAD(osize);

In both cases, the ""how much was actually allocated?"" question is answered
_after_ the allocation, where the compiler hinting is not in an easy place
to make the association any more. This mismatch between the compiler's
view of the buffer length and the code's intention about how much it is
going to actually use has already caused problems[1]. It is possible to
fix this by reordering the use of the ""actual size"" information.

We can serve the needs of users of ksize() and still have accurate buffer
length hinting for the compiler by doing the bucket size calculation
_before_ the allocation. Code can instead ask ""how large an allocation
would I get for a given size?"".

Introduce kmalloc_size_roundup(), to serve this function so we can start
replacing the ""anticipatory resizing"" uses of ksize().

When CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS is enabled we currently increase the minimum
slab alignment to 16.  This happens even if MTE is not supported in
hardware or disabled via kasan=off, which creates an unnecessary memory
overhead in those cases.  Eliminate this overhead by making the minimum
slab alignment a runtime property and only aligning to 16 if KASAN is
enabled at runtime.

Calling kmem_obj_info() via kmem_dump_obj() on KFENCE objects has been
producing garbage data due to the object not actually being maintained
by SLAB or SLUB.

Fix this by implementing __kfence_obj_info() that copies relevant
information to struct kmem_obj_info when the object was allocated by
KFENCE; this is called by a common kmem_obj_info(), which also calls the
slab/slub/slob specific variant now called __kmem_obj_info().

For completeness, kmem_dump_obj() now displays if the object was
allocated by KFENCE.

We currently allocate scope for every memcg to be able to tracked on
every superblock instantiated in the system, regardless of whether that
superblock is even accessible to that memcg.

These huge memcg counts come from container hosts where memcgs are
confined to just a small subset of the total number of superblocks that
instantiated at any given point in time.

For these systems with huge container counts, list_lru does not need the
capability of tracking every memcg on every superblock.  What it comes
down to is that adding the memcg to the list_lru at the first insert.
So introduce kmem_cache_alloc_lru to allocate objects and its list_lru.
In the later patch, we will convert all inode and dentry allocation from
kmem_cache_alloc to kmem_cache_alloc_lru.

After the memory is freed, it can be immediately allocated by other
CPUs, before the ""free"" trace report has been emitted.  This causes
inaccurate traces.

For example, if the following sequence of events occurs:

    CPU 0                 CPU 1

  (1) alloc xxxxxx
  (2) free  xxxxxx
                         (3) alloc xxxxxx
                         (4) free  xxxxxx

Then they will be inaccurately reported via tracing, so that they appear
to have happened in this order:

    CPU 0                 CPU 1

  (1) alloc xxxxxx
                         (2) alloc xxxxxx
  (3) free  xxxxxx
                         (4) free  xxxxxx

This makes it look like CPU 1 somehow managed to allocate memory that
CPU 0 still had allocated for itself.

In order to avoid this, emit the ""free xxxxxx"" tracing report just
before the actual call to free the memory, instead of just after it.

Currently, a trace record generated by the RCU core is as below.

... kmem_cache_free: call_site=rcu_core+0x1fd/0x610 ptr=00000000f3b49a66

It doesn't tell us what the RCU core has freed.

This patch adds the slab name to trace_kmem_cache_free().
The new format is as follows.

... kmem_cache_free: call_site=rcu_core+0x1fd/0x610 ptr=0000000037f79c8d name=dentry
... kmem_cache_free: call_site=rcu_core+0x1fd/0x610 ptr=00000000f78cb7b5 name=sock_inode_cache
... kmem_cache_free: call_site=rcu_core+0x1fd/0x610 ptr=0000000018768985 name=pool_workqueue
... kmem_cache_free: call_site=rcu_core+0x1fd/0x610 ptr=000000006a6cb484 name=radix_tree_node

We can use it to understand what the RCU core is going to free. For
example, some users maybe interested in when the RCU core starts
freeing reclaimable slabs like dentry to reduce memory pressure.

There are kernel facilities such as per-CPU reference counts that give
error messages in generic handlers or callbacks, whose messages are
unenlightening.  In the case of per-CPU reference-count underflow, this
is not a problem when creating a new use of this facility because in that
case the bug is almost certainly in the code implementing that new use.
However, trouble arises when deploying across many systems, which might
exercise corner cases that were not seen during development and testing.
Here, it would be really nice to get some kind of hint as to which of
several uses the underflow was caused by.

This commit therefore exposes a mem_dump_obj() function that takes
a pointer to memory (which must still be allocated if it has been
dynamically allocated) and prints available information on where that
memory came from.  This pointer can reference the middle of the block as
well as the beginning of the block, as needed by things like RCU callback
functions and timer handlers that might not know where the beginning of
the memory block is.  These functions and handlers can use mem_dump_obj()
to print out better hints as to where the problem might lie.

The information printed can depend on kernel configuration.  For example,
the allocation return address can be printed only for slab and slub,
and even then only when the necessary debug has been enabled.  For slab,
build with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y, and either use sizes with ample space
to the next power of two or use the SLAB_STORE_USER when creating the
kmem_cache structure.  For slub, build with CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y and
boot with slub_debug=U, or pass SLAB_STORE_USER to kmem_cache_create()
if more focused use is desired.  Also for slub, use CONFIG_STACKTRACE
to enable printing of the allocation-time stack trace.

Extracted from slab.h, which seems to have the most complete version
including the correct might_sleep() check.  Roll it out to slob.c.

Motivated by a discussion with Paul about possibly changing call_rcu
behaviour to allocate memory, but only roughly every 500th call.

There are a lot fewer places in the kernel that care about whether
allocating memory is allowed or not (due to deadlocks with reclaim code)
than places that care whether sleeping is allowed.  But debugging these
also tends to be a lot harder, so nice descriptive checks could come in
handy.  I might have some use eventually for annotations in drivers/gpu.

Note that unlike fs_reclaim_acquire/release gfpflags_allow_blocking does
not consult the PF_MEMALLOC flags.  But there is no flag equivalent for
GFP_NOWAIT, hence this check can't go wrong due to
memalloc_no*_save/restore contexts.  Willy is working on a patch series
which might change this:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200625113122.7540-7-willy@infradead.org/

I think best would be if that updates gfpflags_allow_blocking(), since
there's a ton of callers all over the place for that already.

In order to prepare for per-object slab memory accounting, convert
NR_SLAB_RECLAIMABLE and NR_SLAB_UNRECLAIMABLE vmstat items to bytes.

To make it obvious, rename them to NR_SLAB_RECLAIMABLE_B and
NR_SLAB_UNRECLAIMABLE_B (similar to NR_KERNEL_STACK_KB).

Internally global and per-node counters are stored in pages, however memcg
and lruvec counters are stored in bytes.  This scheme may look weird, but
only for now.  As soon as slab pages will be shared between multiple
cgroups, global and node counters will reflect the total number of slab
pages.  However memcg and lruvec counters will be used for per-memcg slab
memory tracking, which will take separate kernel objects in the account.
Keeping global and node counters in pages helps to avoid additional
overhead.

The size of slab memory shouldn't exceed 4Gb on 32-bit machines, so it
will fit into atomic_long_t we use for vmstats.

In most configurations, kmalloc() happens to return naturally aligned
(i.e.  aligned to the block size itself) blocks for power of two sizes.

That means some kmalloc() users might unknowingly rely on that
alignment, until stuff breaks when the kernel is built with e.g.
CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG or CONFIG_SLOB, and blocks stop being aligned.  Then
developers have to devise workaround such as own kmem caches with
specified alignment [1], which is not always practical, as recently
evidenced in [2].

The topic has been discussed at LSF/MM 2019 [3].  Adding a
'kmalloc_aligned()' variant would not help with code unknowingly relying
on the implicit alignment.  For slab implementations it would either
require creating more kmalloc caches, or allocate a larger size and only
give back part of it.  That would be wasteful, especially with a generic
alignment parameter (in contrast with a fixed alignment to size).

Ideally we should provide to mm users what they need without difficult
workarounds or own reimplementations, so let's make the kmalloc()
alignment to size explicitly guaranteed for power-of-two sizes under all
configurations.  What this means for the three available allocators?

* SLAB object layout happens to be mostly unchanged by the patch.  The
  implicitly provided alignment could be compromised with
  CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB due to redzoning, however SLAB disables redzoning for
  caches with alignment larger than unsigned long long.  Practically on at
  least x86 this includes kmalloc caches as they use cache line alignment,
  which is larger than that.  Still, this patch ensures alignment on all
  arches and cache sizes.

* SLUB layout is also unchanged unless redzoning is enabled through
  CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG and boot parameter for the particular kmalloc cache.
  With this patch, explicit alignment is guaranteed with redzoning as
  well.  This will result in more memory being wasted, but that should be
  acceptable in a debugging scenario.

* SLOB has no implicit alignment so this patch adds it explicitly for
  kmalloc().  The potential downside is increased fragmentation.  While
  pathological allocation scenarios are certainly possible, in my testing,
  after booting a x86_64 kernel+userspace with virtme, around 16MB memory
  was consumed by slab pages both before and after the patch, with
  difference in the noise.

Patch series ""guarantee natural alignment for kmalloc()"", v2.

This patch (of 2):

SLOB currently doesn't account its pages at all, so in /proc/meminfo the
Slab field shows zero.  Modifying a counter on page allocation and
freeing should be acceptable even for the small system scenarios SLOB is
intended for.  Since reclaimable caches are not separated in SLOB,
account everything as unreclaimable.

SLUB currently doesn't account kmalloc() and kmalloc_node() allocations
larger than order-1 page, that are passed directly to the page
allocator.  As they also don't appear in /proc/slabinfo, it might look
like a memory leak.  For consistency, account them as well.  (SLAB
doesn't actually use page allocator directly, so no change there).

Ideally SLOB and SLUB would be handled in separate patches, but due to
the shared kmalloc_order() function and different kfree()
implementations, it's easier to patch both at once to prevent
inconsistencies.

Currently we use the page->lru list for maintaining lists of slabs.  We
have a list_head in the page structure (slab_list) that can be used for
this purpose.  Doing so makes the code cleaner since we are not
overloading the lru list.

The slab_list is part of a union within the page struct (included here
stripped down):

	union {
		struct {	/* Page cache and anonymous pages */
			struct list_head lru;
			...
		};
		struct {
			dma_addr_t dma_addr;
		};
		struct {	/* slab, slob and slub */
			union {
				struct list_head slab_list;
				struct {	/* Partial pages */
					struct page *next;
					int pages;	/* Nr of pages left */
					int pobjects;	/* Approximate count */
				};
			};
		...

Here we see that slab_list and lru are the same bits.  We can verify that
this change is safe to do by examining the object file produced from
slob.c before and after this patch is applied.

Steps taken to verify:

 1. checkout current tip of Linus' tree

    commit a667cb7a94d4 (""Merge branch 'akpm' (patches from Andrew)"")

 2. configure and build (select SLOB allocator)

    CONFIG_SLOB=y
    CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT=y

 3. dissasemble object file `objdump -dr mm/slub.o > before.s
 4. apply patch
 5. build
 6. dissasemble object file `objdump -dr mm/slub.o > after.s
 7. diff before.s after.s

Use slab_list list_head instead of the lru list_head for maintaining
lists of slabs.

Currently we reach inside the list_head.  This is a violation of the layer
of abstraction provided by the list_head.  It makes the code fragile.
More importantly it makes the code wicked hard to understand.

The code reaches into the list_head structure to counteract the fact that
the list _may_ have been changed during slob_page_alloc().  Instead of
this we can add a return parameter to slob_page_alloc() to signal that the
list was modified (list_del() called with page->lru to remove page from
the freelist).

This code is concerned with an optimisation that counters the tendency for
first fit allocation algorithm to fragment memory into many small chunks
at the front of the memory pool.  Since the page is only removed from the
list when an allocation uses _all_ the remaining memory in the page then
in this special case fragmentation does not occur and we therefore do not
need the optimisation.

Add a return parameter to slob_page_alloc() to signal that the allocation
used up the whole page and that the page was removed from the free list.
After calling slob_page_alloc() check the return value just added and only
attempt optimisation if the page is still on the list.

Use list_head API instead of reaching into the list_head structure to
check if sp is at the front of the list.

Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.

By default all files without license information are under the default
license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.

Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.

This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
Philippe Ombredanne.

How this work was done:

Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
the use cases:
 - file had no licensing information it it.
 - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
 - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,

Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.

The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.

The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.

Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
 - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
 - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
   lines of source
 - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
   lines).

All documentation files were explicitly excluded.

The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
identifiers to apply.

 - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
   considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
   COPYING file license applied.

   For non */uapi/* files that summary was:

   SPDX license identifier                            # files
   ---------------------------------------------------|-------
   GPL-2.0                                              11139

   and resulted in the first patch in this series.

   If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was ""GPL-2.0 WITH
   Linux-syscall-note"" otherwise it was ""GPL-2.0"".  Results of that was:

   SPDX license identifier                            # files
   ---------------------------------------------------|-------
   GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930

   and resulted in the second patch in this series.

 - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
   of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
   any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
   it (per prior point).  Results summary:

   SPDX license identifier                            # files
   ---------------------------------------------------|------
   GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
   GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
   ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
   ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
   LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
   GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
   ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
   LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
   LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
   ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
   ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1

   and that resulted in the third patch in this series.

 - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
   the concluded license(s).

 - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
   license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
   licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.

 - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
   resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
   which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).

 - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
   confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.

 - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
   the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
   in time.

In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.

Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
they are related.

Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
in about 15000 files.

In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
correct identifier.

Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
version early this week with:
 - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
   license ids and scores
 - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
   files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
 - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
   was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
   SPDX license was correct

This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
different types of files to be modified.

These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
generate the patches.

A while ago someone, and I cannot find the email just now, asked if we
could not implement the RECLAIM_FS inversion stuff with a 'fake' lock
like we use for other things like workqueues etc. I think this should
be possible which allows reducing the 'irq' states and will reduce the
amount of __bfs() lookups we do.

Removing the 1 IRQ state results in 4 less __bfs() walks per
dependency, improving lockdep performance. And by moving this
annotation out of the lockdep code it becomes easier for the mm people
to extend.

A group of Linux kernel hackers reported chasing a bug that resulted
from their assumption that SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU provided an existence
guarantee, that is, that no block from such a slab would be reallocated
during an RCU read-side critical section.  Of course, that is not the
case.  Instead, SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU only prevents freeing of an entire
slab of blocks.

However, there is a phrase for this, namely ""type safety"".  This commit
therefore renames SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU to SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU in order
to avoid future instances of this sort of confusion.

synchronize_sched() is a heavy operation and calling it per each cache
owned by a memory cgroup being destroyed may take quite some time.  What
is worse, it's currently called under the slab_mutex, stalling all works
doing cache creation/destruction.

Actually, there isn't much point in calling synchronize_sched() for each
cache - it's enough to call it just once - after setting cpu_partial for
all caches and before shrinking them.  This way, we can also move it out
of the slab_mutex, which we have to hold for iterating over the slab
cache list.

Adjust kmem_cache_alloc_bulk API before we have any real users.

Adjust API to return type 'int' instead of previously type 'bool'.  This
is done to allow future extension of the bulk alloc API.

A future extension could be to allow SLUB to stop at a page boundary, when
specified by a flag, and then return the number of objects.

The advantage of this approach, would make it easier to make bulk alloc
run without local IRQs disabled.  With an approach of cmpxchg ""stealing""
the entire c->freelist or page->freelist.  To avoid overshooting we would
stop processing at a slab-page boundary.  Else we always end up returning
some objects at the cost of another cmpxchg.

To keep compatible with future users of this API linking against an older
kernel when using the new flag, we need to return the number of allocated
objects with this API change.

MDY6Q29tbWl0MjMyNTI5ODo5NmRiODAwZjVkNzNjZDVjNDk0NjEyNTNkNDU3NjZlMDk0ZjBmOGMy,Vlastimil Babka,Linus Torvalds,"mm: rename alloc_pages_exact_node() to __alloc_pages_node()

alloc_pages_exact_node() was introduced in commit 6484eb3e2a81 (""page
allocator: do not check NUMA node ID when the caller knows the node is
valid"") as an optimized variant of alloc_pages_node(), that doesn't
fallback to current node for nid == NUMA_NO_NODE.  Unfortunately the
name of the function can easily suggest that the allocation is
restricted to the given node and fails otherwise.  In truth, the node is
only preferred, unless __GFP_THISNODE is passed among the gfp flags.

The misleading name has lead to mistakes in the past, see for example
commits 5265047ac301 (""mm, thp: really limit transparent hugepage
allocation to local node"") and b360edb43f8e (""mm, mempolicy:
migrate_to_node should only migrate to node"").

Another issue with the name is that there's a family of
alloc_pages_exact*() functions where 'exact' means exact size (instead
of page order), which leads to more confusion.

To prevent further mistakes, this patch effectively renames
alloc_pages_exact_node() to __alloc_pages_node() to better convey that
it's an optimized variant of alloc_pages_node() not intended for general
usage.  Both functions get described in comments.

It has been also considered to really provide a convenience function for
allocations restricted to a node, but the major opinion seems to be that
__GFP_THISNODE already provides that functionality and we shouldn't
duplicate the API needlessly.  The number of users would be small
anyway.

Existing callers of alloc_pages_exact_node() are simply converted to
call __alloc_pages_node(), with the exception of sba_alloc_coherent()
which open-codes the check for NUMA_NO_NODE, so it is converted to use
alloc_pages_node() instead.  This means it no longer performs some
VM_BUG_ON checks, and since the current check for nid in
alloc_pages_node() uses a 'nid < 0' comparison (which includes
NUMA_NO_NODE), it may hide wrong values which would be previously
exposed.

Both differences will be rectified by the next patch.

To sum up, this patch makes no functional changes, except temporarily
hiding potentially buggy callers.  Restricting the checks in
alloc_pages_node() is left for the next patch which can in turn expose
more existing buggy callers.

Add the basic infrastructure for alloc/free operations on pointer arrays.
It includes a generic function in the common slab code that is used in
this infrastructure patch to create the unoptimized functionality for slab
bulk operations.

Allocators can then provide optimized allocation functions for situations
in which large numbers of objects are needed.  These optimization may
avoid taking locks repeatedly and bypass metadata creation if all objects
in slab pages can be used to provide the objects required.

Allocators can extend the skeletons provided and add their own code to the
bulk alloc and free functions.  They can keep the generic allocation and
freeing and just fall back to those if optimizations would not work (like
for example when debugging is on).

To speed up further allocations SLUB may store empty slabs in per cpu/node
partial lists instead of freeing them immediately.  This prevents per
memcg caches destruction, because kmem caches created for a memory cgroup
are only destroyed after the last page charged to the cgroup is freed.

To fix this issue, this patch resurrects approach first proposed in [1].
It forbids SLUB to cache empty slabs after the memory cgroup that the
cache belongs to was destroyed.  It is achieved by setting kmem_cache's
cpu_partial and min_partial constants to 0 and tuning put_cpu_partial() so
that it would drop frozen empty slabs immediately if cpu_partial = 0.

The runtime overhead is minimal.  From all the hot functions, we only
touch relatively cold put_cpu_partial(): we make it call
unfreeze_partials() after freezing a slab that belongs to an offline
memory cgroup.  Since slab freezing exists to avoid moving slabs from/to a
partial list on free/alloc, and there can't be allocations from dead
caches, it shouldn't cause any overhead.  We do have to disable preemption
for put_cpu_partial() to achieve that though.

The original patch was accepted well and even merged to the mm tree.
However, I decided to withdraw it due to changes happening to the memcg
core at that time.  I had an idea of introducing per-memcg shrinkers for
kmem caches, but now, as memcg has finally settled down, I do not see it
as an option, because SLUB shrinker would be too costly to call since SLUB
does not keep free slabs on a separate list.  Besides, we currently do not
even call per-memcg shrinkers for offline memcgs.  Overall, it would
introduce much more complexity to both SLUB and memcg than this small
patch.

Regarding to SLAB, there's no problem with it, because it shrinks
per-cpu/node caches periodically.  Thanks to list_lru reparenting, we no
longer keep entries for offline cgroups in per-memcg arrays (such as
memcg_cache_params->memcg_caches), so we do not have to bother if a
per-memcg cache will be shrunk a bit later than it could be.

Now, we track caller if tracing or slab debugging is enabled.  If they are
disabled, we could save one argument passing overhead by calling
__kmalloc(_node)().  But, I think that it would be marginal.  Furthermore,
default slab allocator, SLUB, doesn't use this technique so I think that
it's okay to change this situation.

After this change, we can turn on/off CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB without full
kernel build and remove some complicated '#if' defintion.  It looks more
benefitial to me.

When we create a sl[au]b cache, we allocate kmem_cache_node structures
for each online NUMA node.  To handle nodes taken online/offline, we
register memory hotplug notifier and allocate/free kmem_cache_node
corresponding to the node that changes its state for each kmem cache.

To synchronize between the two paths we hold the slab_mutex during both
the cache creationg/destruction path and while tuning per-node parts of
kmem caches in memory hotplug handler, but that's not quite right,
because it does not guarantee that a newly created cache will have all
kmem_cache_nodes initialized in case it races with memory hotplug.  For
instance, in case of slub:

    CPU0                            CPU1
    ----                            ----

     __kmem_cache_create:            slab_memory_callback:
                                      slab_mem_going_online_callback:
                                       lock slab_mutex
                                       for each slab_caches list entry
                                           allocate kmem_cache node
                                       unlock slab_mutex
      lock slab_mutex
      init_kmem_cache_nodes:
       for_each_node_state(node, N_NORMAL_MEMORY)
           allocate kmem_cache node
      add kmem_cache to slab_caches list
      unlock slab_mutex
                                    online_pages (continued):
                                     node_states_set_node

As a result we'll get a kmem cache with not all kmem_cache_nodes
allocated.

To avoid issues like that we should hold get/put_online_mems() during
the whole kmem cache creation/destruction/shrink paths, just like we
deal with cpu hotplug.  This patch does the trick.

Note, that after it's applied, there is no need in taking the slab_mutex
for kmem_cache_shrink any more, so it is removed from there.

'struct page' has two list_head fields: 'lru' and 'list'.  Conveniently,
they are unioned together.  This means that code can use them
interchangably, which gets horribly confusing like with this nugget from
slab.c:

>	list_del(&page->lru);
>	if (page->active == cachep->num)
>		list_add(&page->list, &n->slabs_full);

This patch makes the slab and slub code use page->lru universally instead
of mixing ->list and ->lru.

So, the new rule is: page->lru is what the you use if you want to keep
your page on a list.  Don't like the fact that it's not called ->list?
Too bad.

The kmalloc* functions of all slab allcoators are similar now so
lets move them into slab.h. This requires some function naming changes

As a results of this patch there is a common set of functions for
all allocators. Also means that kmalloc_large() is now available
in general to perform large order allocations that go directly
via the page allocator. kmalloc_large() can be substituted if
kmalloc() throws warnings because of too large allocations.

kmalloc_large() has exactly the same semantics as kmalloc but
can only used for allocations > PAGE_SIZE.

While doing some code inspection, I noticed that the slob constructor
method can be called with a NULL pointer. If memory is tight and slob
fails to allocate with slob_alloc() or slob_new_pages() it still calls
the ctor() method with a NULL pointer. Looking at the first ctor()
method I found, I noticed that it can not handle a NULL pointer (I'm
sure others probably can't either):

static void sighand_ctor(void *data)
{
        struct sighand_struct *sighand = data;

        spin_lock_init(&sighand->siglock);
        init_waitqueue_head(&sighand->signalfd_wqh);
}

The solution is to only call the ctor() method if allocation succeeded.

""mm, slob: Add support for kmalloc_track_caller()"" breaks the build

Currently slob falls back to regular kmalloc for this case.
With this patch kmalloc_track_caller() is correctly implemented,
thus tracing the specified caller.

This is important to trace accurately allocations performed by
krealloc, kstrdup, kmemdup, etc.

Therefore these other structures can be freed before the rcu deferred

Define a struct that describes common fields used in all slab allocators.
A slab allocator either uses the common definition (like SLOB) or is
required to provide members of kmem_cache with the definition given.

After that it will be possible to share code that
only operates on those fields of kmem_cache.

The patch basically takes the slob definition of kmem cache and
uses the field namees for the other allocators.

It also standardizes the names used for basic object lengths in
allocators:

object_size	Struct size specified at kmem_cache_create. Basically
		the payload expected to be used by the subsystem.

size		The size of memory allocator for each object. This size
		is larger than object_size and includes padding, alignment
		and extra metadata for each object (f.e. for debugging
		and rcu).

Doing a ktest.pl randconfig, I stumbled across the following bug
on boot up:

---[ end trace a7919e7f17c0a725 ]---

Then I ran a ktest.pl config_bisect and it came up with this config
as the problem:

  CONFIG_SLOB

Looking at what is different between SLOB and SLAB and SLUB, I found
that the gfp flags are masked against gfp_allowed_mask in
SLAB and SLUB, but not SLOB.

On boot up, interrupts are disabled and lockdep will warn if some flags
are set in gfp and interrupts are disabled. But these flags are masked
off with the gfp_allowed_mask during boot. Because SLOB does not
mask the flags against gfp_allowed_mask it triggers the warn on.

Adding this mask fixes the bug. I also found that kmem_cache_alloc_node()
was missing both the mask and the lockdep check, and that was added too.

Callers of alloc_pages_node() can optionally specify -1 as a node to mean
""allocate from the current node"".  However, a number of the callers in

Here is another version, with the incremental patch rolled up, and
added reclaim context annotation to kswapd, and allocation tracing
to slab allocators (which may only ever reach the page allocator
in rare cases, so it is good to put annotations here too).

Haven't tested this version as such, but it should be getting closer
to merge worthy ;)

--
After noticing some code in mm/filemap.c accidentally perform a __GFP_FS
allocation when it should not have been, I thought it might be a good idea to
try to catch this kind of thing with lockdep.

I coded up a little idea that seems to work. Unfortunately the system has to
actually be in __GFP_FS page reclaim, then take the lock, before it will mark
it. But at least that might still be some orders of magnitude more common
(and more debuggable) than an actual deadlock condition, so we have some
improvement I hope (the concept is no less complete than discovery of a lock's
interrupt contexts).

I guess we could even do the same thing with __GFP_IO (normal reclaim), and
even GFP_NOIO locks too... but filesystems will have the most locks and fiddly
code paths, so let's start there and see how it goes.

It *seems* to work. I did a quick test.

Yeah I shall confess kmem_minimalistic should be: kmem_alternative.

Whatever, I find it more readable but this a personal opinion of course.
We can drop it if you want.

On the ALLOC/FREE column, + means an allocation and - a free.

On the type column, you have K = kmalloc, C = cache, P = page

I would like the flags to be GFP_* strings but that would not be easy to not
break the column with strings....

About the node...it seems to always be -1. I don't know why but that shouldn't
be difficult to find.

I moved linux/tracepoint.h to trace/tracepoint.h as well. I think that would
be more easy to find the tracer headers if they are all in their common
directory.

The version of SLOB in -mm always scans its free list from the beginning,

beginning of the list over time.  This causes the average search to scan

By starting each page search where the last one left off, we evenly
distribute the allocations and greatly shorten the average search.

A kernel convention for many allocators is that if __GFP_ZERO is passed to an
allocator then the allocated memory should be zeroed.

This is currently not supported by the slab allocators.  The inconsistency
makes it difficult to implement in derived allocators such as in the uncached
allocator and the pool allocators.

In addition the support zeroed allocations in the slab allocators does not
have a consistent API.  There are no zeroing allocator functions for NUMA node
placement (kmalloc_node, kmem_cache_alloc_node).  The zeroing allocations are
only provided for default allocs (kzalloc, kmem_cache_zalloc_node).
__GFP_ZERO will make zeroing universally available and does not require any
addititional functions.

So add the necessary logic to all slab allocators to support __GFP_ZERO.

The code is added to the hot path.  The gfp flags are on the stack and so the
cacheline is readily available for checking if we want a zeroed object.

Zeroing while allocating is now a frequent operation and we seem to be
gradually approaching a 1-1 parity between zeroing and not zeroing allocs.
The current tree has 3476 uses of kmalloc vs 2731 uses of kzalloc.

it is, and the only hiccup is a missing slab_is_available() in the case of
sparsemem extreme.  With this, we're rid of the last set of restrictions

This adds preliminary NUMA support to SLOB, primarily aimed at systems with
small nodes (tested all the way down to a 128kB SRAM block), whether
asymmetric or otherwise.

We follow the same conventions as SLAB/SLUB, preferring current node
placement for new pages, or with explicit placement, if a node has been
specified.  Presently on UP NUMA this has the side-effect of preferring
node#0 allocations (since numa_node_id() == 0, though this could be
reworked if we could hand off a pfn to determine node placement), so
single-CPU NUMA systems will want to place smaller nodes further out in
terms of node id.  Once a page has been bound to a node (via explicit node
id typing), we only do block allocations from partial free pages that have
a matching node id in the page flags.

The current implementation does have some scalability problems, in that all
partial free pages are tracked in the global freelist (with contention due
to the single spinlock).  However, these are things that are being reworked
for SMP scalability first, while things like per-node freelists can easily
be built on top of this sort of functionality once it's been added.

introduce the alignment restrictions at the slab API layer.  This lets us heed
the ARCH_KMALLOC/SLAB_MINALIGN directives, and also use __alignof__ (unsigned

architectures to take better advantage of SLOB's small minimum alignment).

Improve slob by turning the freelist into a list of pages using struct page
fields, then each page has a singly linked freelist of slob blocks via a
pointer in the struct page.

- The first benefit is that the slob freelists can be indexed by a smaller
  type (2 bytes, if the PAGE_SIZE is reasonable).

- Next is that freeing is much quicker because it does not have to traverse
  the entire freelist. Allocation can be slightly faster too, because we can
  skip almost-full freelist pages completely.

- Slob pages are then freed immediately when they become empty, rather than
  having a periodic timer try to free them. This gives efficiency and memory
  consumption improvement.

Then, we don't encode seperate size and next fields into each slob block,
rather we use the sign bit to distinguish between ""size"" or ""next"". Then
size 1 blocks contain a ""next"" offset, and others contain the ""size"" in
the first unit and ""next"" in the second unit.

- This allows minimum slob allocation alignment to go from 8 bytes to 2
  bytes on 32-bit and 12 bytes to 2 bytes on 64-bit. In practice, it is
  best to align them to word size, however some architectures (eg. cris)
  could gain space savings from turning off this extra alignment.

Then, make kmalloc use its own slob_block at the front of the allocation
in order to encode allocation size, rather than rely on not overwriting
slob's existing header block.

- This reduces kmalloc allocation overhead similarly to alignment reductions.

- Decouples kmalloc layer from the slob allocator.

Then, add a page flag specific to slob pages.

- This means kfree of a page aligned slob block doesn't have to traverse
  the bigblock list.

I would get benchmarks, but my test box's network doesn't come up with
slob before this patch. I think something is timing out. Anyway, things
are faster after the patch.

Code size goes up about 1K, however dynamic memory usage _should_ be
lower even on relatively small memory systems.

Future todo item is to restore the cyclic free list search, rather than
to always begin at the start.

There is no user of destructors left.  There is no reason why we should keep
checking for destructors calls in the slab allocators.

The RFC for this patch was discussed at
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117882364330705&w=2

Destructors were mainly used for list management which required them to take a
spinlock.  Taking a spinlock in a destructor is a bit risky since the slab
allocators may run the destructors anytime they decide a slab is no longer
needed.

Patch drops destructor support.  Any attempt to use a destructor will BUG().

This is a response to an earlier discussion on linux-mm about splitting

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=116469577431008&w=2

This patch cleans up the slab header definitions.  We define the common
functions of slob and slab in slab.h and put the extra definitions needed
for slab's kmalloc implementations in <linux/slab_def.h>.  In order to get
a greater set of common functions we add several empty functions to slob.c
and also rename slob's kmalloc to __kmalloc.

Slob does not need any special definitions since we introduce a fallback
case.  If there is no need for a slab implementation to provide its own
kmalloc mess^H^H^Hacros then we simply fall back to __kmalloc functions.
That is sufficient for SLOB.

Sort the function in slab.h according to their functionality.  First the
functions operating on struct kmem_cache * then the kmalloc related
functions followed by special debug and fallback definitions.

Also redo a lot of comments.

configurable replacement for slab allocator

This adds a CONFIG_SLAB option under CONFIG_EMBEDDED.  When CONFIG_SLAB is
disabled, the kernel falls back to using the 'SLOB' allocator.

SLOB is a traditional K&R/UNIX allocator with a SLAB emulation layer,
similar to the original Linux kmalloc allocator that SLAB replaced.  It's
signicantly smaller code and is more memory efficient.  But like all
similar allocators, it scales poorly and suffers from fragmentation more
than SLAB, so it's only appropriate for small systems.

It's been tested extensively in the Linux-tiny tree.  I've also
stress-tested it with make -j 8 compiles on a 3G SMP+PREEMPT box (not
recommended).

Here's a comparison for otherwise identical builds, showing SLOB saving
nearly half a megabyte of RAM:
